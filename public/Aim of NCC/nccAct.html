        <ol>
            <li><b>Introduction to the NCC Act</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>The <b>National Cadet Corps</b> Act was enacted in <b>1948</b> by the Indian Parliament to
                    officially establish the NCC. The NCC was created with the purpose of instilling discipline,
                    leadership, and patriotism among young citizens, while also preparing them for service in the
                    defense forces, if they choose to pursue such a path.</li>
            </ul><br />
            <li><b>Key Objectives of the NCC Act</b></li>
            <p>The NCC Act sets the foundation for achieving the following objectives:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Character Development:</b> To nurture qualities such as discipline, self-confidence, leadership,
                    and teamwork among students.</li>
                <li><b>Patriotic Spirit:</b> To foster a sense of duty and love for the country among the youth.</li>
                <li><b>Consequences of Low Attendance:</b> Failure to meet the attendance requirements may lead to
                    disqualification from NCC activities, camps, or future promotions.</li>
                <li><b>Preparation for Defense Services:</b> To provide basic military training and instill readiness
                    for those who may wish to serve in the armed forces.</li>
                <li><b>Community Service:</b> To encourage students to contribute positively to society through
                    community and social services.</li>
            </ul><br />
            <li><b>Structure of the NCC Under the Act</b></li>
            <p>The NCC Act outlines the overall structure of the NCC in India:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>National Level:</b> At the highest level, NCC is under the <b>Ministry of Defence</b> and headed
                    by the <b>Director General (DG NCC)</b>, a senior officer from the Indian Armed Forces.
                </li>
                <li><b>Regional Level:</b> At the regional level, NCC is divided into <b>Directorates</b> (one for each
                    state or region) which manage the activities across colleges and schools in that area.</li>
                <li><b>Units:</b> The <b>NCC Units</b> are the local bodies that function at the school or college
                    level. Each unit has a <b>Commanding Officer (CO)</b> and is overseen by an <b>Associate NCC Officer
                        (ANO)</b>.
                </li>
            </ul><br />
            <li><b>Enrolment Guidelines Under the NCC Act</b></li>
            <p>As per the NCC Act, any student can enroll in NCC if:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They are a <b>citizen of India</b>.</li>
                <li>They meet the required <b>physical and medical standards</b>.</li>
                <li>They fall within the prescribed <b>age limits:</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Junior Division:</b> 13-18.5 years for school students.</li>
                    <li><b>Senior Division:</b> Up to 26 years for college students.</li>

                </ul>

                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once enrolled, cadets must attend regular training sessions and participate in camps and other NCC

            <li><b>The Role of the Associate NCC Officer (ANO)</b></li>
            <p>According to the NCC Act, the Associate NCC Officer (ANO) plays a key role in ensuring the smooth
                functioning of NCC in colleges and schools. The ANO is responsible for:</p>

            <li><b>Exemptions & Benefits for NCC Cadets Under the Act</b></li>

                    schedules due to participation in NCC activities, camps, or parades.</li>

            </ul><br />
            <li><b>Regulation of Camps and Training</b></li>
            <p>The NCC Act sets out detailed regulations regarding:</p>
            <ul>

            </ul><br />
            <li><b>Penalties for Misconduct or Non-compliance</b></li>

                </li>

            <p>These penalties could range from warnings to suspension, or in severe cases, <b>removal from the NCC
                    program.</b></p>
            <br />
            <li><b>Withdrawal and Re-Enrollment</b></li>
            <p>The NCC Act allows for the withdrawal of cadets who are unable to continue for valid reasons (e.g.,
                health issues). The process for withdrawal involves notifying the ANO and completing the required forms.
            </p>
            <p>Cadets who wish to re-enroll must submit a fresh application, which will be reviewed based on
                availability and past performance.</p>
            <br />
            <li><b>Financial Provisions </b></li>

                <li><b>Private/Self-Financed Institutions:</b> The institution must bear the costs related to uniforms,
                    equipment, and training. In certain cases, NCC headquarters may provide some support.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
